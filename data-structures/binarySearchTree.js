/*
BINARY SEARCH TREES

Abstract data type
A binary search tree is a tree with the additional constraints:
- each node has only two child nodes (node.left and node.right)
- all the values in the left subtree of a node are less than or equal to the value of the node
- all the values in the right subtree of a node are greater than the value of the node

*** Operations:

bsTree.insert(value)
=> bsTree (return for chaining purposes)
Insert value into correct position within tree

bsTree.contains(value)
=> true/false
Return true if value is in tree, false if not

bsTree.traverseDepthFirst_inOrder(callback)
=> undefined
Invoke the callback for every node in a depth-first in-order (visit left branch, then current node, than right branch)
Note: In-Order traversal is most common type for binary trees. For binary search tree, this visits the nodes in ascending order (hence the name).

bsTree.traverseDepthFirst_preOrder(callback)
=> undefined
Invoke the callback for every node in a depth-first pre-order (visits current node before its child nodes)

bsTree.traverseDepthFirst_postOrder(callback)
=> undefined
Invoke the callback for every node in a depth-first post-order (visit the current node after its child nodes)

bsTree.isValid()
=> returns true if BST is a valid BST otherwise returns false. This method is useful for checking your other methods.

bsTree.removeNode(value)
=> node
Remove node from tree.

bsTree.checkIfFull()
=> true/false
A binary tree is full if every node has either zero or two children (no nodes have only one child)

bsTree.checkIfBalanced()
=> true/false
For this exercise, let's say that a tree is balanced if the minimum height and the maximum height differ by no more than 1. The height for a branch is the number of levels below the root.


*** Additional Exercises:
A binary search tree was created by iterating over an array and inserting each element into the tree. Given a binary search tree with no duplicates, how many different arrays would result in the creation of this tree.
