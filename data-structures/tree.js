/*
TREES

Abstract data type

General Tree:
A tree has a root node.
The root node has 0 or more children.
Each child node has 0 or more children.
(each node in the tree can be seen as a subtree)

Constraints:
A child has only one parent and the root node has no parent.
Note: A tree is a special type of graph. A tree is a graph without cycles.

*** Operations:

tree.addChild(value)
=> child node (new tree)
add child to tree/subtree and return child node (which should be a tree instance)

tree.contains(value)
=> true/false
Return true if value is in tree, false if not

tree.traverseDepthFirst(callback)
=> undefined
Invoke the callback for every node in a depth-first order

tree.traverseBreadthFirst(callback)
=> undefined
Invoke the callback for every node in a breadth-first order

*** Additional Exercises:
Given treeA and treeB, check if treeB is a subtree of treeA (meaning that there exists a node n in treeA such that the subtree of n is identical to treeB).

Given a dictionary, create a prefix tree (commonly known as a trie)
