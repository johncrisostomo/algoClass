/*

Write a function that outputs the nth Fibonnaci number. A number in this sequence is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Fibonnaci's sequence:
input    0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8  9 ...
output   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...

What is the time complexity? Can you think of optimizing your solution? (Hint: look up dynamic programming)
